LumenLens is a powerful backend solution tailored for a blog application, offering secure authentication, CRUD operations, and additional features to enhance the user experience. Built using Lumen, a lightweight PHP framework, it provides efficient endpoints for seamless communication between the frontend and server.

## Responsibilities
During my involvement with LumenLens, I had the following responsibilities:
- Designed and implemented RESTful APIs to enable smooth communication between the frontend and the server.
- Leveraged Lumen, a PHP micro-framework, to develop a robust and scalable backend, ensuring optimal performance for the blog application.
- Implemented secure user authentication and authorization mechanisms to safeguard user data and ensure privacy.
- Developed and maintained a MySQL database for efficient storage and management of blog posts, user data, and application-related information.
- Integrated Postman collections for easy API testing and documentation, ensuring reliability and ease of use.
- Collaborated closely with frontend developers to ensure seamless integration and compatibility.
- Implemented comprehensive testing using PHPUnit to validate individual components and ensure the reliability of the backend system.

## Project Technologies & Tools
The project utilized the following technologies and tools:
- Lumen (PHP Micro-framework)
- MySQL
- Postman
- PHPUnit
- Git

### To Run the Application
